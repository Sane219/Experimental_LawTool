# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Legal Document Summarizer implements comprehensive security and data protection measures to ensure client confidentiality and protect sensitive legal documents. This document outlines all security features and best practices implemented in the application.

## Security Architecture

### 1. HTTPS Configuration and Secure Communication

**Implementation**: `src/utils/https_config.py`

- **TLS 1.2+ Only**: Enforces minimum TLS version 1.2 for all connections
- **Strong Cipher Suites**: Uses ECDHE+AESGCM and CHACHA20 cipher suites
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: Automatically generates certificates for development
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers including:
  - Strict-Transport-Security with preload
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - Content-Security-Policy with strict rules
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Comprehensive Permissions-Policy

**Key Features**:
- Automatic certificate detection from environment variables
- Fallback to self-signed certificates for development
- SSL context validation and error handling
- Temporary certificate cleanup

### 2. In-Memory Processing and Data Protection

**Implementation**: `src/services/security_service.py`

- **No Persistent Storage**: Documents are processed entirely in memory
- **Secure Temporary Files**: Temporary files are securely overwritten before deletion
- **Session Data Management**: Encrypted session storage with automatic expiration
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data from memory

**Key Features**:
- Secure session ID generation using cryptographically secure random numbers
- Automatic cleanup thread for expired data and orphaned files
- Three-pass secure file deletion with random data overwriting
- Session data TTL (Time To Live) with automatic expiration

### 3. Advanced Memory Management

**Implementation**: `src/utils/memory_manager.py`

- **Sensitive Object Tracking**: Tracks objects containing sensitive data
- **Memory Pressure Monitoring**: Monitors system memory usage
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Force cleanup under memory pressure
- **Secure Data Clearing**: Overwrites sensitive data before deletion

**Key Features**:
- Weak reference tracking for automatic cleanup
- Memory usage statistics and monitoring
- Garbage collection optimization
- Secure buffer implementation for sensitive data

### 4. Security Middleware and Request Validation

**Implementation**: `src/utils/security_middleware.py`

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Request Validation**: Detects SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal attempts
- **Session Management**: Secure session creation and validation
- **Security Headers**: Automatic application of security headers

**Key Features**:
- Configurable rate limiting with sliding window
- Pattern-based threat detection
- Session timeout and cleanup
- Security event logging

### 5. Secure Logging

**Implementation**: `src/utils/secure_logging.py`

- **Data Sanitization**: Automatically redacts sensitive information from logs
- **Secure Formatting**: Custom formatter that removes document content
- **Security Event Logging**: Dedicated logging for security events
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log cleanup and retention

**Key Features**:
- Pattern-based sensitive data detection
- File path sanitization
- Error context sanitization
- Structured security event logging

### 6. Configuration Management

**Implementation**: `src/utils/security_config.py`

- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Security settings from environment variables
- **Validation**: Comprehensive configuration validation
- **Security Levels**: Different security profiles for development/production
- **Centralized Settings**: Single source of truth for security configuration

- Secure file deletion with multiple overwrite passes
- Automatic session data expiration
- Background cleanup threads
- Emergency cleanup procedures

### Requirement 7.3: HTTPS Communication
✅ **Implemented**: All communications use HTTPS encryption
- TLS 1.2+ enforcement
- Strong cipher suite selection
- Certificate validation
- Security headers for additional protection

### Requirement 7.4: Session Data Clearing
✅ **Implemented**: Automatic session data clearing and memory management
- Session timeout and expiration

- Force garbage collection

### Requirement 7.5: Data Protection Measures
✅ **Implemented**: Comprehensive data protection throughout the application
- Request validation and threat detection
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Secure logging with data sanitization
- Configuration-based security controls

## Security Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual security component testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end security workflow testing
- **Security Tests**: Specific security threat and vulnerability testing

### Test Files
- `tests/security/test_security_measures.py`: Comprehensive security testing
- Covers all security components and integration scenarios
- Validates threat detection and prevention
- Tests cleanup and memory management

## Deployment Security

### Production Configuration
```bash
# Environment variables for production
SECURITY_LEVEL=production
ENABLE_HTTPS=true
REQUIRE_HTTPS=true
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=60
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Security Checklist
- [ ] HTTPS certificates configured
- [ ] Security headers enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Session timeout set appropriately
- [ ] Logging configured with sanitization
- [ ] Memory limits configured
- [ ] File upload limits enforced

## Security Monitoring

### Logged Security Events
- File validation failures
- Rate limit violations
- Request validation failures (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal)
- Memory pressure events
- Session management events
- Cleanup operations

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor security event logs for patterns
- Set up alerts for repeated security violations
- Monitor memory usage and cleanup effectiveness
- Regular security configuration validation

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always use the security service for temporary file creation
2. Track sensitive objects with the memory manager
3. Use secure logging for all error handling
4. Validate all user inputs through security middleware
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Deployment
1. Use production security configuration
2. Regularly update SSL certificates
3. Monitor security logs and events
4. Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing
